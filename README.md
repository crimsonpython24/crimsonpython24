<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

I lurk in private repos, working on projects that fate forbid be uncovered :) 

Yes I'm a web dev. No I do not have a personal site. Feel free to check out my [resume](https://drive.proton.me/urls/3B12JQDNFG#XXaguP2gljWH) though ![thonk](https://github.com/crimsonpython24/crimsonpython24/blob/main/thonk-2.webp "Apple Thinking Emoji.")

I code like molasses, 2/3 due to schoolwork, and 1/3 because I sleep 9 hrs a day & nothing will change that

I learned in chronological order:
 - Flask/HTML-CSS/jQuery/SQLite
 - Django/Postgres/React/Redis
 - Next/WebSocket/TypeScript/Tailwind âœ¨AKAâœ¨ the influencer-freecodecamp stack before it became so
 - GraphQL/urql/Mocha/Jest/Docker
 - Task management, product design, and code maintenance $$\leftarrow$$ present

Currently ~~in dire need of financial benefits~~ open to work!

I'm also a wannabe database/security engineer, linux wizard of some sort, and professional <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tabletennisdaily.com/forum/members/snakicized17.147746/#about">table tennis player</a>.
