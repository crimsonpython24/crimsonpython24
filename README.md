<!-- ### Hi there üëã -->

I lurk in private repos, working on projects that god forbid be uncovered :) 

I do have plenty of schoolwork but that's only 2/3 of the reason why I commit code like molasses. The other 1/3 is because I sleep 9 hrs per day, and nothing will change that

Personal website WIP i.e. it will take another 1.5 years to be published

I learned (in chronological order) 
 - Flask/HTML-CSS/jQuery/SQLite
 - Django/Postgres/Redis
 - Node/React/TS/tailwind AKA the influencer stack before it became so

I'm also a wannabe full-time backend dev, database/devops engineer, and professional table tennis player*
