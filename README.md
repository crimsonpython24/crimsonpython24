<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

I lurk in private repos, working on projects that fate forbid be uncovered :) 

Yes I'm a web dev. No I do not have a personal site yet.

I code like molasses, $$\frac{2}{3}$$ because I have plenty of schoolwork, and $$\frac{1}{3}$$ because I sleep 9+ hrs a day & nothing will change that

I learned in chronological order:
 - Flask/HTML-CSS/jQuery/SQLite
 - Django/Postgres/Redis/Celery
 - Node/React/TS/Tailwind âœ¨AKAâœ¨ the influencer-freecodecamp stack before it became so
 - GraphQL/urql/Next/Mocha/Jest $$\leftarrow$$ I'm here

Currently ~~in dire need of financial benefits~~ open to work!

I'm also a wannabe backend dev, database/security engineer, linux wizard of some sort, and professional <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tabletennisdaily.com/forum/members/crimsonpython24.104645/#about">table tennis player</a>.
