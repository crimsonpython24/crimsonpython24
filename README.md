<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

I lurk in private repos, working on projects that fate forbid be uncovered :) 

Yes I'm a web dev. No I do not have a personal site. But you can learn more about me through my resume ([PDF](https://drive.proton.me/urls/3B12JQDNFG#XXaguP2gljWH))!

I code like molasses, 2/3 because I have plenty of schoolwork, and 1/3 because I sleep 9+ hrs a day & nothing will change that

I learned in chronological order:
 - Flask/HTML-CSS/jQuery/SQLite
 - Django/Postgres/Redis/Celery
 - Node/React/TS/Tailwind âœ¨AKAâœ¨ the influencer-freecodecamp stack before it became so
 - GraphQL/urql/Next/Mocha/Jest $$\leftarrow$$ currently here

Currently ~~in dire need of financial benefits~~ open to work!

I'm also a wannabe database/security engineer, linux wizard of some sort, and professional <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tabletennisdaily.com/forum/members/snakicized17.147746/#about">table tennis player</a>.
