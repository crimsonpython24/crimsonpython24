<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

I lurk in private repos, working on projects that fate forbid be uncovered :) 

> i.e., trying to earn a living wage by working multiple web dev jobs & signing NDAs

<div style="display: inline">

</div>

I commit code like molasses, 2/3 because I have plenty of schoolwork, and 1/3 because I sleep 9+ hrs a day & nothing will change that

I learned (in chronological order) 
 - Flask/HTML-CSS/jQuery/SQLite
 - Django/Postgres/Redis/Celery
 - Node/React/TS/tailwind AKA the influencer-freecodecamp stack before it became so

I'm also a wannabe backend dev, database/security engineer, apple product hater, and professional table tennis player.
