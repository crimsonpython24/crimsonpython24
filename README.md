<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

I lurk in private repos, working on projects that fate forbid be uncovered :) 

> i.e., trying to get hired post-undergrad by working $Zâˆ¼N(2,0.5)$ unpaid frontend dev jobs & signing NDAs

Yes I'm a web dev. No I do not have a personal site yet.

</div>

I code like molasses, 2/3 because I have plenty of schoolwork, and 1/3 because I sleep 9+ hrs a day & nothing will change that

I learned (in chronological order) 
 - Flask/HTML-CSS/jQuery/SQLite
 - Django/Postgres/Redis/Celery
 - Node/React/TS/tailwind âœ¨AKAâœ¨ the influencer-freecodecamp stack before it became so

I'm also a wannabe backend dev, database/security engineer, linux wizard of some sort, and professional table tennis player.
