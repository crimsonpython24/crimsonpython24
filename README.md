<!-- ### Hi there 👋 -->

I lurk in private repos, working on projects that fate forbid be uncovered :) 

I commit code like molasses, 2/3 because I have plenty of schoolwork, and 1/3 because I sleep 9 hrs per day & nothing will change that

Personal website WIP i.e. it will take another 1.5 years to be published. idk what to put as well

I learned (in chronological order) 
 - Flask/HTML-CSS/jQuery/SQLite
 - Django/Postgres/Redis
 - Node/React/TS/tailwind AKA the influencer stack before it became so

I'm also a wannabe full-time backend dev, database/devops engineer, and professional table tennis player*
