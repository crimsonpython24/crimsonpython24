<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

I lurk in private repos, working on projects that God forbid be uncovered :) 

Personal website WIP i.e. it will take another 1.5 years to be published

I learned (in chronological order) Flask/HTML-CSS/jQuery/SQLite/Django/React/Postgres/TS/Redis/Node AKA the influencer stack before it became so

I'm also a wannabe full-time backend dev, database/devops engineer, and professional table tennis player
