<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

I lurk in private repos, working on projects that fate forbid be uncovered :) 

> i.e., trying to get hired post-undergrad by working $$f(x) = \frac{1}{x \cdot 0.3 \cdot \sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot e^{-\frac{(\ln(x) - 0.35)^2}{2*0.3^2}}$$ unpaid web dev jobs

Yes I'm a web dev. No I do not have a personal site yet.

I code like molasses, 2/3 because I have plenty of schoolwork, and 1/3 because I sleep 9<em>+</em> hrs a day & nothing will change that

I learned (in chronological order) 
 - Flask/HTML-CSS/jQuery/SQLite
 - Django/Postgres/Redis/Celery
 - Node/React/TS/tailwind âœ¨AKAâœ¨ the influencer-freecodecamp stack before it became so

I'm also a wannabe backend dev, database/security engineer, linux wizard of some sort, and professional <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tabletennisdaily.com/forum/members/crimsonpython24.104645/#about">table tennis player</a>.
